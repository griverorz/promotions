\section{Theory}

Sometimes one skips seniority and the ladder altogether. For instance, X
promoted the members of his cabinet to captains. Similarly, X skipped few ranks.
However, those situations are rare and sometimes lead to violent reactions from
the rest of the military. For instance, when the newly appointed dictator
decided to promote himself to general, a coup ensued. Much more common are
situations in which the ruler bends the rules slightly. For instance, it was
common knowledge that (scretario de franco) skipped the mandatory instruction
for his grade of Admiral. 

Franco granted general rank or higher to people wanted to put out of circulation.

We know of many situations in which the autocrat puts too much emphasis
on one dimension. But some of those end up in either a violent removal through a
civil war (CAR or Sierra Leone) or a straight removal via a coup.
